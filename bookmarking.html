       <p align="justify">“Ihave a question,” said the vampire, leaning on the bar next to me. “If you screw a celestial soldier, does that guarantee you a place in heaven?”

        “No,” I said, “but I can offer you a one-way ticket to hell if you take one more step.” I lifted my hand to show the celestial mark on the underside of my wrist. It was shaped like an arrowhead, and his proximity—like any preternatural being—brought out a flash of white light underneath the tanned skin of my wrist. If I turned the power up to max,he’d probably go up in flames. The vamp’s cocky grin slipped, and he quickly slunk away back to his mates on the other side of the bar.

        I switched off the light and took another sip of my drink. On reflection, this wasn’t the type of bar you went to if you preferred to avoid attention. Even if I hid my tattoo, my aura was visible to certain people—piercingly white, like the Divinity who’d given me the mark. It didn’t fit with my cheap tank top and jeans, but I’d deliberately played down my appearance.</p><p align="justify"> The trouble with places like this is that if you’re not one of them, they catch on pretty fast. Still, a job was a job, and my client had offered a reasonable bonus… if he ever showed up. I’d been here an hour and had burned through my patience when it came to rowdy vamps playing drinking games and knocking glasses over. Whoever thought vampires were a bunch of ancient stiffs had never been to the Royal Arms at Happy Hour.
        
        Tapping my foot on the edge of the bar stool, I ordered another drink. As I did so, a man sidled over to me. I stiffened, ready to flip my wrist over and flash the mark again, but he sat without a word. His red-tinted eyes and the glowing undercurrent to his dusky skin indicated his vampire status. If the curved incisors visible when he opened his mouth weren’t enough of a clue.

        <p align="justify">Ah, shit. The client was a vamp. I liked to avoid working for vamps, or warlocks, or weres… basically, anyone with preternatural abilities. But he’d seen my ad and apparently ignored the strong hints that I preferred to deal with humans who’d ended up in some magical dilemma or other. Not the people who were more likely to have caused a magical dilemma.

            “Yes,” I said. “I am. Are you Mr Evans?”
            
            He’d called me this morning and asked for help catching a thief. No hints at anything weird. I should have known something was up when he’d suggested meeting in this preternaturally inclined bar. The vamps in the corner were about the least threatening group of bloodsuckers I’d ever seen, but if ever there was an opportunity to pounce on me and force me to kill someone again, this was it. Raucous laughter came from the corner, where one of the vamps had brought a keg filled with some sort of blood cocktail mixed with tequila. Good luck to the poor sod who had to clean the carpets afterwards.
            
            “As I said, something valuable was stolen from me last night,” he said, in a raspy voice. He cast an irritated look at the vamps, who were now drunkenly singing along to Queen beside the old-fashioned jukebox and getting half the words wrong. Vampires looked ageless, but these ones were apparently stuck in student-aged party animal mode forever.</p>

<p align="justify">Thankfully, it’d stopped raining by the time I departed the train station at the high street. Everything had a grey, washed-out look. I couldn’t help thinking of the wasteland that lay here, in another world. A world in ruin. Like so many others. Dienes’s world, too. Even if I’d grudgingly accepted that not all warlocks were pure evil, the idea of demons wreaking havoc on this realm didn’t exactly fill me with confidence. I needed to disconnect myself from the warlocks as soon as possible. Solve the crime, and then disappear from the inspector’s sight before I got locked in a cell.</p>
<p align="justify">That was what a sensible person would do, anyway. But sensible people didn’t wind up working with warlocks in the first place—let alone walking to my third murder site within the last two days.

    The corner of the street was cordoned off with police tape. A brief scan from a distance didn’t give me any information. With the body gone, all that remained were ashes, washed away by the rain. This was a public place. No wonder there’d been an uproar. What I needed was a witness to question. The streets hadn’t been deserted last night, and there’d been a large number of people going in and out of the pub. But it was closed at this time, with blinds over the windows like a vampire’s den in daylight.
    
    The normal-looking pub on the opposite corner was open, however. I strode casually inside and peered into the gloom. Nobody was around except for a disinterested-looking barman slowly polishing a glass. He spotted me right away—not hard, because there were no customers. And he was definitely human.
    
    “Hi.” I walked over to him. “I’m Devina, and I’m investigating the murder that occurred outside your pub last night.”
    
    “Celestial.” His gaze darted to my wrist, which was covered. He’d guessed what I was anyway, then. I often wondered how people could tell. Maybe it was how I walked.
    
    “Yeah. I’d like to know if you or any of your customers witnessed the girl’s death.”</p>
